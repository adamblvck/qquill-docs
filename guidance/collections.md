# Collections

Collections are a primary way to categorize your things. We recommend creating collections for every project, or general theme, that you're going through in life. Within collections, sub-collections can be created, allowing for further orgnization of your thoughts and ideas.

## General Approach To Collections

Every QQuill user will create his own approach towards Collections. Here are a few examples of possible collection setups:

For someone on the path of some scientific topic, eg "Photonics"
- Collection "Photonics Ideas"
  - When busy considering and learning things about photonics, put ideas (both good and bad ones) in this collection, for later review, and iteration on them.
- Collection "Lab A - Experiments 23"
  - Put things regarding important experimental results
- Collection "Important Science News"
  - Collect things regarding important scientific news and articles, either attach them (or link them), or write abstracts regarding the content. We recommend doing the latter.
- Collection "Connections"
  - Collect important people as "things" in here, including important interactions, things that you know about these people, and more.

For someone on the path of self-improvement, with teachings from infuencer *Huberman*, *David Hoggings*, and *Gary Vee*:
- Collection "Life's Goals"
- Collection "Huberman Lessons"
- Collection "David Hoggings"
- Collection "Gary Vee"

For someone on the path of Buddhism / meditation:

- Collection "Buddhism"
  - Here you can gather things regarding your journey towards learning the teachings of Buddhism in your own words.
- Collection "Meditation"
  - Here you can gather things that come up during meditation, including thoughts, anger, experiences, breakthroughs, or even emotional frustrations which cause reluctance towards practise.

For someone on the path of Magick and Esotericism:

- Collection "Ritual Journal"
- Collection "Hermetic Philosophy"
- Collection "Golden Dawn Teachings"
- Collection "Ritual Jou"

Make sure to add a memorable background and description to your collection, allowing you to memorize it better and better, in more memorizable ways than ever.

## Smart Collections

Smart Collections are normal collections with extended *dynamic functionality* based on filters, user activity, and user interaction. The idea is to gather these into a group of things which you'd lik to keep track of over time.

Perhaps you'd like to have a collection with all things which belong to a certain tag? Perhaps you'd like to keep track of all things with a combination of a certain, elements.

When you open QQuill, you'll be met with preconigured collections:
- The "General Journal" Collection - which gives a nice overview of your latest activities, created posts and comments, in a journal fashion, grouped neatly per day.
- "Dream Journal" Collection.
