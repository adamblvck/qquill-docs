# Universal Tags

Using universal tags, one uses a system of categorization, like the four elements, or the seven planets, and gives a specific series of meanings within a given field. This then makes QQuill highly customizable and flexible, while providing a solid framework for note taking, brainstorming, and naming the unnamble.

For example, within the field of mathematics, one could use the following "words", given the four elements:
- Air: Previous result
- Fire: Let / Assume / If
- Water: Then / Derivation Step / Proof Step
- Earth: Result / Fact / QED

Thus, one can cut out lots of words out of formal proof, creating beautiful symbolic outlines, enhancing thinking.
