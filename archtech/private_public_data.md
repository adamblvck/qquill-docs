# Private & Public Data

In QQuill, data is seperated into to major categories:
- private data
- public data

**Private data** is data which you're creating and generating yourself by using QQuill.

**Public data** is published data, either by yourself, or by others, which can be accessed through the Akashic Lens.

Most of QQuill's workflow revolves around privately writing and engaging with your notes, concepts and ideas, gathering them in collections, and re-engaging with them over time. This involves linking concepts together, refining them by iterations, or even making them evolve through elemental energies.

Certain ideas might then want to get published, either for inspiration for others, or for collaborative features of QQuill. This involves publishing private data to a public domain.

When engaging with your private data, all data remains on device, and can be backed up in the cloud, either plain text, or encrypted (we recommend encrypting all your data). For this you may either choose to use QQuill's Backup Service, or Google Drive backups.

To enjoy synchronization, or gain access to any of QQuill's public services, one has to create an account. There are three ways to create an account in QQuill:

- Google Sign-In
  - In this case, authentication happens via `JWT-tokens` provided by Google
- QQuill - Email + Public Key Authentication
  - In this case, authentication happens via a username and public key signature verification.
