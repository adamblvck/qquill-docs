# QQuill Documentation

Welcome to QQuill Docs! Here's you'll find detail expositions on how to use QQuill its purpose, architecture, and business model.

QQuill started as an effort to create a self-focused alternative to social media - where one gets to "consume" one's own ideas, much like one does so when using Social Media. The was called SpellBook, and is now steadily growing into a bigger and stronger app.

QQuill is an open-source project, mainly because it uses advanced encryption to keep data safe between yourself and other users. Hence why in the name of transparency and love, the app has been made open source.
