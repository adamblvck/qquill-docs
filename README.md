# SpellBook Documentation

Welcome to SpellBook Docs! Here's you'll find in detail explanations on how the app is built, its purpose, architecture, and business model.

I'm building SpellBook as a self-sustaining business based on 100% transparency and no hidden agendas. This in order to challenge the habits of the current business sphere, especially during times of great uncertainty and information overflood, where algorithms are progressively in charge of what gets into your eyes and ears, determining your moods and worldview.

In this way, my decision to go open source came to its summit after yearlong contemplation on it. It came after implementing data encryption of SpellBook's data, such that no-fucking-body can read the content of it, except you! Now, as I was prepping my app update launch, I learned that US Export Laws (and thus Google Play and App Store) require app developers to either hire a team of lawyers to satisfy Gov Dept of Export needs with "Usage Reporting On All Encrypted Services", I learned that an exception clausule is allowed, if the app is open sourced.

Being as that may be, going open source means that other people will start to ask questions, raise concerns, and collaborate on the project - this requires impeccable documentation, so here's my ongoing shot.

## About SpellBook
