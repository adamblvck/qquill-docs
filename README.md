# QQuill Documentation

Welcome to QQuill Docs! Here's you'll find detailed expositions on how to use QQuill, its purpose, architecture, and business model.

QQuill started as an effort to create a self-focused alternative to social media - where one gets to "consume" one's own ideas and mind space, much like one does so when using Social Media. The was called SpellBook, and is now steadily growing into a bigger and advanced app.

QQuill is an open-source project, mainly because it uses advanced encryption to keep data safe between yourself and other users. Hence why in the name of transparency and love, the app has been made open source.

> What is QQuill?!

QQuill is an app which introduces a novel way of structuring thought processes through the four elements, seven planets, and beyond. Aside from structuring, QQuill introduces a first of its kind algorithmic "Self-Feed", which allows a users to reengage with their past ideas, contemplations, and musings, see them in new light, and best of all, deepening the notion of Authentic Acquired Wisdom.

> Guidance

The **Guidance Section** features a guidance section for those who want to learn how to use QQuill and its many features, to enrich their inner lives, and march onward equipped and empowered with their inner visions.
